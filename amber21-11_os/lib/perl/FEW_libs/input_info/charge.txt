# Specification of ligand molecule charge for those ligands that have a total charge
# that is not equal to zero.
# First column: Name of structure in <i_path> folder. Either self chosen
#               name or name automatically set by the system. In the latter case the 
#               name is equal to "Lig_<name in multi mol2 or sdf file>.mol2" or if
#               no name is present in the multiple mol2 file: 
#               "Lig_<number of structure in the multi mol2 file>.mol2"
# Second column: Total charge of the ligand molecule
# Third column: Multiplicity of the ligand molecule
# 
Lig_10.mol2	1	1
Lig_14.mol2	1	1
