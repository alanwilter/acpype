#
#   mm_pbsa allows to calculate (absolute) free energies for one molecular
#     species or a free energy difference according to:
#
#     Receptor + Ligand = Complex,
#     DeltaG = G(Complex) - G(Receptor) - G(Ligand).
#
#   VERBOSE - If set to 1, input and output files are not removed. This is
#             useful for debugging purposes.
#   PARALLEL - If set to values > 1, energy calculations for snapshots are
#              done in parallel, using PARALLEL number of threads. 
#
#   PREFIX - To the prefix, "{_com, _rec, _lig}.crd.Number" is added during
#            generation of snapshots as well as during mm_pbsa calculations.
#   PATH - Specifies the location where to store or get snapshots.
#   START - Specifies the first snapshot to be used in energy calculations
#           (optional, defaults to 1).
#   STOP - Specifies the last snapshot to be used in energy calculations 
#          (optional, defaults to 10e10).
#   OFFSET - Specifies the offset between snapshots in energy calculations 
#            (optional, defaults to 1).
#
#   COMPLEX - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.
#   RECEPTOR - Set to 1 if either (absolute) free energy or free energy
#              difference are calculated.
#   LIGAND - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.
#
#   COMPT - parmtop file for the complex (not necessary for option GC).
#   RECPT - parmtop file for the receptor (not necessary for option GC).
#   LIGPT - parmtop file for the ligand (not necessary for option GC).
#
#   GC - Snapshots are generated from trajectories (see below).
#   AS - Residues are mutated to Ala during generation of snapshots from
#        trajectories.
#   DC - Decompose the free energies into individual contributions.
#        (When using DC, MM and GB must be set to 1, even if a PB decomposition
#         is also requested.)
#
#   MM - Calculation of gas phase energies using sander.
#   GB - Calculation of desolvation free energies using the GB models in sander
#        (see below).
#   PB - Calculation of desolvation free energies using the PB method and

#        (see below).

@DECOMP
#
# Energy decomposition parameters
# (this section is only relevant if DC = 1 above)
#
#   Energy decomposition is performed for gasphase energies, desolvation free
#     energies calculated with GB or PB, and nonpolar contributions to
#     desolvation using the ICOSA method.
#   For amino acids, decomposition is also performed with respect to backbone
#     and sidechain atoms.
#
#   DCTYPE - Values of 1 or 2 yield a decomposition on a per-residue basis,
#            values of 3 or 4 yield a decomposition on a pairwise per-residue
#              basis. For the latter, so far the number of pairs must not
#              exceed the number of residues in the molecule considered.
#            Values 1 or 3 add 1-4 interactions to bond contributions.
#            Values 2 or 4 add 1-4 interactions to either electrostatic or vdW
#              contributions.
#
#   COMREC - Residues belonging to the receptor molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   COMLIG - Residues belonging to the ligand molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   RECRES - Residues in the receptor molecule.
#   LIGRES - Residues in the ligand molecule.
#   {COM,REC,LIG}PRI - Residues considered for output.
#   {REC,LIG}MAP - Residues in the complex which are equivalent to the residues
#                  in the receptor molecule or the ligand molecule.

@PB
#
# PB parameters (this section is only relevant if PB = 1 above)
#
#   The following parameters are passed to the PB solver.
#   Additional input parameters may also be added here. See the sander PB
#   documentation for more options.
#
#   PROC -  Determines which program is used for solving the PB equation:
#           Delphi (PROC == 1), PBSA (PROC == 2), or APBS (PROC == 3).
#           By default, PROC == 2, the pbsa program of the AMBER suite is used.
#   REFE -  Determines which reference state is taken for PB calc:
#           By default, REFE == 0, reaction field energy is calculated with
#           EXDI/INDI. Here, INDI must agree with DIELC from MM part.
#   INDI -  Dielectric constant for the solute.
#   EXDI -  Dielectric constant for the surrounding solvent.
#   ISTRNG - Ionic strength (in mM) for the Poisson-Boltzmann solvent.
#   SCALE - Lattice spacing in no. of grids per Angstrom.
#   LINIT - No. of iterations with linear PB equation.
#   RADIOPT - Option to set up radii for PB calc:
#             0: uses the radii from the prmtop file. Default.
#             1: uses the radii optimized by Tan and Luo with respect to the
#                reaction field energies computed in the TIP3P explicit solvents
#                (Tan & Luo, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 18680-18687). 
#                Note that optimized radii are based on AMBER atom types
#                (upper case) and charges. Radii from the prmtop files are used
#                if the atom types are defined by antechamber (lower case).
#   ARCRES - Resolution (in the unit of Angstrom) of solvent accessible arcs
#   IVCAP - If set to 1, a solvent sphere (specified by CUTCAP,XCAP,YCAP,
#           and ZCAP) is excised from a box of water. If set to 5, a solvent
#           shell is excised, specified by CUTCAP (the thickness of the shell 
#           in A). The electrostatic part of the solvation free energy is 
#           estimated from a linear response approximation using the explicit 
#           solvent plus a reaction field contribution from outside the sphere 
#           (i.e., a hybrid solvation approach is pursued). 
#           In addition, the nonpolar contribution is estimated from a sum of 
#           (attractive) dispersion interactions calc. between the solute and 
#           the solvent molecules plus a (repulsive) cavity contribution 
#           (Gohlke & Case, J. comput. Chem. 2004, 25, 238-250). 
#           For the latter, the surface calculation must be done with MS = 1 and
#           the PROBE should be set to 1.4 to get the solvent excluded surface.
#           In this case bondi radii are used as cavity radii set.
#   CUTCAP - Radius of the water sphere or thickness of the water shell.
#            Note that the sphere must enclose the whole solute.
#   XCAP  - Location of the center of the water sphere.
#   YCAP
#   ZCAP
#
# NP Parameters for nonpolar solvation energies if MS = 0
#
#   INP   - Option for modeling nonpolar solvation free energy.
#           See sander PB documentation for more information on the
#           implementations by Tan and Luo.
#           1: uses the solvent-accessible-surface area to correlate total
#              nonpolar solvation free energy:
#              Gnp = SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF. Default.
#           2: uses the solvent-accessible-surface area to correlate the
#              repulsive (cavity) term only, and uses a surface-integration
#              approach to compute the attractive (dispersion) term:
#              Gnp = Gdisp + Gcavity
#                  = Gdisp + SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF.
#           When this option is used, RADIOPT has to be set to 1,
#           i.e. the radii set optimized by Tan and Luo.
#   SURFTEN/SURFOFF - Values used to compute the nonpolar
#           solvation free energy Gnp acccording to INP.
#           If INP = 1 and RADIOPT = 0 (default, see above),
#           use SURFTEN/SURFOFF parameters that fit with the radii from the
#           prmtop file, e.g., 
#           use SURFTEN: 0.00542 and SURFOFF: 0.92 for PARSE radii.
#           If INP = 2 and RADIOPT = 1, please set these to the following: 
#           SURFTEN: 0.0378; OFFSET: -0.5692
#
# NP Parameters for nonpolar solvation energies if MS = 1
#
#   SURFTEN/SURFOFF - Values used to compute the nonpolar contribution Gnp to
#           the desolvation according to:
#      (I)  Gnp = SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF (if IVCAP == 0)
#           Use parameters that fit with the radii from the reaction field
#           calculation. E.g., use SURFTEN: 0.00542, SURFOFF: 0.92 for
#           PARSE radii 
#      (II) Gnp = Gdisp + Gcavity = Gdisp + SURFTEN * SESA + SURFOFF (IVCAP > 0)
#           Nonpolar solvation free energy calculated as discribed for IVCAP > 0
#           above. In this case use SURFTEN: 0.069; SURFOFF: 0.00 for
#           calculating the Gcavity contribution.
