# General parameters
#   0: means NO; >0: means YES
#
#   mm_pbsa allows to calculate (absolute) free energies for one molecular
#     species or a free energy difference according to:
#
#     Receptor + Ligand = Complex,
#     DeltaG = G(Complex) - G(Receptor) - G(Ligand).
#
#   VERBOSE - If set to 1, input and output files are not removed. This is
#             useful for debugging purposes.
#   PARALLEL - If set to values > 1, energy calculations for snapshots are
#              done in parallel, using PARALLEL number of threads. 
#
#   PREFIX - To the prefix, "{_com, _rec, _lig}.crd.Number" is added during
#            generation of snapshots as well as during mm_pbsa calculations.
#   PATH - Specifies the location where to store or get snapshots.
#   START - Specifies the first snapshot to be used in energy calculations
#           (optional, defaults to 1).
#   STOP - Specifies the last snapshot to be used in energy calculations 
#          (optional, defaults to 10e10).
#   OFFSET - Specifies the offset between snapshots in energy calculations 
#            (optional, defaults to 1).
#
#   COMPLEX - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.
#   RECEPTOR - Set to 1 if either (absolute) free energy or free energy
#              difference are calculated.
#   LIGAND - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.
#
#   COMPT - parmtop file for the complex (not necessary for option GC).
#   RECPT - parmtop file for the receptor (not necessary for option GC).
#   LIGPT - parmtop file for the ligand (not necessary for option GC).
#
#   GC - Snapshots are generated from trajectories (see below).
#   AS - Residues are mutated to Ala during generation of snapshots from
#        trajectories.
#   DC - Decompose the free energies into individual contributions.
#        (When using DC, MM and GB must be set to 1, even if a PB decomposition
#         is also requested.)
#
#   MM - Calculation of gas phase energies using sander.
#   GB - Calculation of desolvation free energies using the GB models in sander
#        (see below).
#   PB - Calculation of desolvation free energies using the PB method and
#        computation of nonpolar solvation free energies according to
#        the INP option in pbsa (see below).
#   MS - Calculation of nonpolar contributions to desolvation using molsurf
#        (see below).
#        If MS == 0 and GB == 1, nonpolar contributions are calculated either
#        with the LCPO (GBSA == 1) or the ICOSA (GBSA == 2) method in sander 
#        (see below).
#        If MS == 0 and PB == 1, nonpolar contributions are calculated according
#        the INP option in pbsa (see below).
#   NM - Calculation of entropies with nmode.

@MAKECRD
#
# The following parameters are passed to make_crd_hg, which extracts snapshots
#   from trajectory files. (This section is only relevant if GC = 1 OR 
#   AS = 1 above.)
#
#   BOX - "YES" means that periodic boundary conditions were used during MD
#         simulation and that box information has been printed in the
#         trajectory files; "NO" means opposite.
#   NTOTAL - Total number of atoms per snapshot printed in the trajectory file
#            (including water, ions, ...).
#   NSTART - Start structure extraction from NSTART snapshot.
#   NSTOP - Stop structure extraction at NSTOP snapshot.
#   NFREQ - Every NFREQ structure will be extracted from the trajectory.
#
#   NUMBER_LIG_GROUPS - Number of subsequent LSTART/LSTOP combinations to
#                       extract atoms belonging to the ligand.
#   LSTART - Number of first ligand atom in the trajectory entry.
#   LSTOP - Number of last ligand atom in the trajectory entry.
#   NUMBER_REC_GROUPS - Number of subsequent RSTART/RSTOP combinations to
#                       extract atoms belonging to the receptor.
#   RSTART - Number of first receptor atom in the trajectory entry.
#   RSTOP - Number of last receptor atom in the trajectory entry.
#   Note: If only one molecular species is extracted, use only the receptor
#         parameters (NUMBER_REC_GROUPS, RSTART, RSTOP).

@TRAJECTORY
#
# Trajectory names
#
#   The following trajectories are used to extract snapshots with "make_crd_hg":
#   Each trajectory name must be preceeded by the TRAJECTORY card.
#   Subsequent trajectories are considered together; trajectories may be
#     in ascii as well as in .gz format.
#   To be able to identify the title line, it must be identical in all files.
