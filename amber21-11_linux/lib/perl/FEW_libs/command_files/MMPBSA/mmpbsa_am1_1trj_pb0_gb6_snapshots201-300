# Parameters for coordinate (snapshot) extraction
#
# extract_snapshots: Request coordinate (snapshot) extraction
# snap_extract_template: Template file for extraction of coordinates from
#                        trajectory, i.e. input-file for mm_pbsa.pl; only
#                        required if non-standard input-file shall be used.
# image_trajectories: If set to "1" solutes of the specified trajectories
#                     will be imaged to the origin before coordinates are
#                     extracted. Please regard that this may require a large
#                     amount of additional disc space.
# use_imaged_trajectories: In case imaged trajectories were created before,
#                          these will be used if 'use_imaged_trajectories=1'.
#                          If 'use_imaged_trajectories=0' new imaged
#                          trajectories will be created even if imaged
#                          trajectories already exist. Default=1.
# trajectory_files: Trajectory files to regard. The path will be determined
#                   automatically. Specify 'all' to regard all trajectories
#                   files produced in MD. This ensures consistent snapshot
#                   numbering. Subsets of snapshots will be generated according
#                   to the parameters first_snapshot, last_snapshot, and
#                   offset_snapshots. If only a subset of the available MD
#                   trajectories shall be used, the individual files must be
#                   specified as 'trajectory_files  <file_name>' providing
#                   one entry per line.
# first_snapshot: First structure that shall be extracted from trajectory
# last_snapshot:  Last structure that shall be extracted from trajectory
# offset_snapshots:  Frequency of structure extraction

# MM-PBSA / MM-GBSA Analysis
# mmpbsa_template: Template file for MM-PBSA / MM-GBSA analysis - File used
#                  as input-file for mm_pbsa.pl; only required if non-standard
#                  file shall be used.
# PB: If not zero PB calculation will be performed
#     Options: "0" -> No PB
#              "1" -> PB with calculation of the non-polar part of the
#                     solvation free energy using the Method developed by
#                     Tan et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2007, 111, 12263-12274).
#                     This method can only be run in combination with GB=1
#                     or GB=0.
#              "2" -> Hybrid model developed by H. Gohlke and A. Metz
#                     with IVCAP=5 and CUTCAP=50
#              "3" -> PB with MS=1 and Parse radii
#              "4" -> PB with MS=1 and mbondi radii. This method can only
#                     be combined with GB=1 or GB=0.
# GB: If not zero GB calculation will be performed
#     Options: "0" -> No GB
#              "1", "2", "5" -> GB analysis according to 'igb' (see manual)
#              "6" -> GBNSR6 analysis (see manual)
#
# decomposition: If larger 0 energy decomposition of specified type is
#                performed. Options: 1-4 - See Amber manual for decomposition
#                type options. Decomposition only works with PB=4 and GB=1.
#                SASA is calculated by the ICOSA method.
# no_of_rec_residues: Number of residues in the receptor structure
#
# total_no_of_intervals: Total number of intervals to analyze.
#                        The total_no_of_intervals needs to be consistent with
#                        the number of 'first_PB_snapshot', 'last_PB_snapshot',
#                        and 'offset_PB_snapshots' definitions below. Setting
#                        total_no_of_intervals to a value larger than 1, is
#                        usually only necessary if snapshots with different 
#                        offsets shall be analyzed.
# first_PB_snapshot: Structure to start analysis with
# last_PB_snapshot: Last structure to regard in analysis
# offset_PB_snapshots: Specification of offset between structures that shall
#                      be regarded in the MM-PBSA calculation
#
# mmpbsa_batch_template: Batch script template for MM-PBSA calculation
# mmpbsa_batch_path: Optional, path to regard as basis path for batch script
#                    setup, in case it differs from <output path>.
#
# mmpbsa_sander_exe: Optional, Sander executable can be defined here if not
#                    the default executable in $AMBERHOME/bin shall be
#                    used for carrying out the MM-PB(GB)SA calculations.
