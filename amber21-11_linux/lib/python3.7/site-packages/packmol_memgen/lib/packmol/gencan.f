c parameters when calling this subroutine). This subroutine does
c nothing.
c      subroutine evalhd(nind,ind,n,x,m,lambda,rho,d,hd,flag)

      subroutine evalhd(n)

C     This subroutine computes the product of the Hessian matrix times
C     the input vector argument d. If GENCAN is being used stand-alone 
C     to solve a bound-constrained problem, the ''Hessian matrix'' must
C     be the Hessian matrix of the objective function. On the other hand,
C     if GENCAN is being used to solve the bound-constrained subproblems
C     in an Augmented Lagrangian framework, the Hessian matrix must be
C     the Hessian of the Augmented Lagrangian function.
C
C     IMPORTANT: This subroutine does not need to be coded if the user
C     prefers to approximate the Hessian-vector product by incremental 
C     quotients. In this case, it is enough to set the GENCAN input
C     argument htvtype equal to 1 and an internal GENCAN subroutine will
C     be used to compute the approximation. In fact, this is the default
C     GENCAN option. See the GENCAN and EASYGENCAN arguments descriptions

      integer wi(n)
      double precision g(n),l(n),lambda(m),rho(m),u(n),wd(8*n),x(n)

C     This subroutine aims to simplify the use of GENCAN. For this 
C     purpose it gives values to most of the GENCAN arguments and 
C     leaves to the user those arguments which he/she may would like to 
C     set by him/herself.
C
C     The arguments of EASYGENCAN are the input and output arguments of 
C     GENCAN that are supposed to be useful for a common user. The input 
C     arguments are mostly related to basic problem information, like 
C     dimension and bounds, and the initial point. There are also input 
C     arguments related to simple stopping criteria (like norm of the 
C     projected gradient, and maximum number of iterations and 
C     functional evaluations). There are also two input arguments 
C     related to control the amount of information written into the 
C     screen. The output arguments are related to information of the 
C     solution and some few performance measurements. Basically, on 
C     return, EASYGENCAN gives to the user the solution, the objective 
C     functional value and its gradient at the solution, Euclidian and 
C     sup-norm of the projected gradient at the solution, the number of 
C     iterations, functional and gradient evaluations, and Conjugate 
C     Gradient iterations used to reach the solution, and, finally, a 
C     flag that indicates the stopping criterion that was satisfied.
C
C     All the other arguments of GENCAN are setted with its default 
C     values by EASYGENCAN. EASYGENCAN divides the arguments of GENCAN 
C     in two sets. Those that are related to the behaviour of GENCAN are 
C     declared as Fortran parameters (constants). The other arguments of 
C     GENCAN, most of them related to alternative stopping criteria, and 
C     that may depend of, for example, maxit, are declared as local 
C     variables of EASYGENCAN.
C
C     GENCAN arguments that are defined as Fortran parameters in this 
C     subroutine are GENCAN arguments that should not be modified by a 
C     common user. They are arguments that modify the behaviour of 
C     GENCAN and whos values were selected because they are classical 
C     values in some cases or because some numerical experiments seemed 
C     to indicate that they are the best choices.
C
C     GENCAN arguments that are declared as local variables in this 
C     subroutine are GENCAN arguments that may be modified if, with 
C     their suggested values, GENCAN does not give the desired result. 
C     Most of them are related to Conjugate Gradients or to disabled 
C     stopping criteria that may be useful in bad-scaled problems or 
C     problems with not trustable derivatives.
C
C     Finally, this subroutine declares as local variables some 
C     arguments of GENCAN which in fact are output arguments. Most of 
C     them are related to quantities that can be used for statistics 
C     related to the GENCAN performance, like number Spectral Projected 
C     Gradient iterations, Truncated Newton iterations, Conjugate 
C     Gradient iterations, etc. As we assume that this values are not 
C     useful for the common user, this subroutine throw all of them 
C     away.
C
C     We describe below the meaning of the arguments of the EASYGENCAN
C     subroutine. More detailed descriptions as well as the descriptions 
C     of all the other GENCAN arguments that are not arguments of 
C     EASYGENCAN are also described at the begining of the GENCAN 
C     subroutine.
C     
C     On entry:
C
C     n        integer 
C              number of variables
C
C     x        double precision x(n)
C              initial estimation of the solution
C
C     l        double precision l(n)
C              lower bounds on the variables
C
C     u        double precision u(n)
C              upper bounds on the variables
C
C     m        integer
C     lambda   double precision lambda(m)
C     rho      double precision rho(m)
C              These three parameters are not used nor modified by 
C              GENCAN and they are passed as arguments to the user-
C              defined subroutines evalal and evalnal to compute the 
C              objective function and its gradient, respectively. 
C              Clearly, in an Augmented Lagrangian context, if GENCAN is 
C              being used to solve the bound-constrainted subproblems, m 
C              would be the number of constraints, lambda the Lagrange 
C              multipliers approximation and rho the penalty parameters
C
C     epsgpsn  double precision
C              GENCAN stops declaring convergence if it finds a point 
C              whos projected gradient sup-norm is smaller than or equal 
C              to epsgpsn
C
C     maxit    integer
C              GENCAN stops declaring ''maximum number of iteration 
C              achieved'' if the number of iterations exceeds maxit
C
C     maxfc    integer
C              the same as before but with the number of functional 
C              evaluations
C
C     iprint   integer
C              indicates the degree of details of the output generated 
C              by GENCAN. Setting iprint to a value smaller than 2 will 
C              make GENCAN to generate no output at all. An iprint value 
C              greater than or equal to 2 will generate information of 
C              every GENCAN iteration. An iprint value greater than or 
C              equal to 3 will also show information of the Conjugate 
C              Gradient iterations (used to compute the Truncated Newton 
C              direction) and also information related to the line 
C              search procedures in the Spectral Projected Gradient 
C              direction and the Truncated Newton direction.
C
C     ncomp    integer
C              Sometimes, vectors like the current point x, the gradient 
C              of the objective function g, or the search directions 
C              (Spectral Projected Gradient direction or Truncated 
C              Newton direction), among other vector, are showed in the 
C              screen. In such cases, if the problem dimension is large, 
C              to show just a few elements of these vectors may be 
C              preferable. Argument ncomp can be used to indicate how 
C              many array elements must be displayed.

C              number of Conjugate Gradient iterations
C
C     inform   integer
C              termination criteria. inform equal to 1 means that 
C              GENCAN converged with the sup-norm of the continuous 
C              projected gradient stopping criterion (inform equal to 0
C              means the same but with the Euclidian norm). Other 
C              positive values means that GENCAN stopped by a may be not  
C              successful stopping criteria. A negative value means that 
C              there was an error in the user-defined subroutines that 
C              computes the objective function (subroutine evalal), the 
C              gradient (subroutine evalnal), or the Hessian-vector
C              product (subroutine evalhd). See the GENCAN description 
C              for more details.

C     HERE STARTS THE DESCRIPTION OF SOME GENCAN ARGUMENTS THAT ARE 
C     BEING SETTED INSIDE EASYGENCAN. THE FIRST SET OF ARGUMENTS ARE 
C     THOSE ARGUMENTS THAT WE WILL CALL ''CONSTANTS'' AND THAT, AS THEIR 
C     VALUES ALTER THE BEHAVIOUR OF GENCAN, SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED BY A 
C     COMMON USER.

C     CONSTANTS FOR GENERAL USES

C     Steps: h = max( steabs, sterel * abs( x ) ) should be a number 
C     such that h is small ( relatively to x ) and x + h is different 
C     from x. So, h is something that can be used a a step for a finite 
C     differences approximation of a partial derivative relative to x.

C     Epsilons: something smaller than max( epsabs, epsrel * abs( x ) )
C     should be considered as ``zero'' when compared with x. It is used, 
C     for example, to detect that a step taken during a line search is 
C     too small.

C     Infinitys: infrel is a big number that may appear in the 
C     calculations. infabs is a number that should never be reached in 
C     the calculations and is used the represent ``infinite''. Detailed 
C     explanations of how are they used are rather cumbersome.

      double precision steabs,sterel,epsabs,epsrel,infabs,infrel
      parameter ( steabs    = 1.0d-10 )
      parameter ( sterel    = 1.0d-07 )
      parameter ( epsabs    = 1.0d-20 )
      parameter ( epsrel    = 1.0d-10 )
      parameter ( infabs    = 1.0d+99 )
      parameter ( infrel    = 1.0d+20 )

C     CONSTANTS FOR CLASSICAL LINE-SEARCH CONDITIONS

C     beta is the constant for the ''beta condition''. We use this 
C     condition to test whether is promising to extrapolate or not.

C     gamma is the constant for the sufficient decrease ''Armijo 
C     condition''.

C     theta is the constant for the ''angle condition''.

C     sigma1 and sigma2 are the constants for the safeguarding quadratic 
C     interpolations. We use them in a rather unusual way. Instead of 
C     discarding a new step anew if it does not belong to the interval 
C     [ sigma1 * aprev, sigma2 * aprev ], we discard it if it does not 
C     belong to the interval [ sigma1, sigma2 * aprev ]. In such a case 
C     we take something similar to ''anew = aprev / 2''.

      double precision beta,gamma,theta,sigma1,sigma2
      parameter ( beta   =   0.5d0 )
      parameter ( gamma  = 1.0d-04 )
      parameter ( theta  = 1.0d-06 )
      parameter ( sigma1 =   0.1d0 )
      parameter ( sigma2 =   0.9d0 )

C     CONSTANTS FOR SPECIFIC PROCEDURES (NOT SO CLASSICAL)

C     In line searches, when interpolating, the step may become so 
C     small that we should declare a line search failure indicating that 
C     direction may not be a descent direction. This decision is never 
C     take before doing at least mininterp interpolations.

C     In line searches, the beta condition (see above) may recommend to
C     extrapolate. We never do more than maxextrap extrapolations.

C     In the line searches, when we need to interpolate and the result 
C     of the quadratic interpolation is rejected, the new step is 
C     computed as anew = aprev / nint. When the beta condition 
C     recommends to extrapolate, we compute anew = aprev * next.

C     When computing the Newton direction by Conjugate Gradients we 
C     never go further an artificial ''trust region''. This ''trust 
C     radius'' is never smaller than delmin.

C     In active set strategies, constants eta is used to decide whether 
C     the current face should be abandoned or not. In particular, the 
C     current face is abandoned when the norm of the internal to face 
C     component of the continuous projected gradient is smaller than 
C     ( 1 - eta ) times the norm of the continuous projected gradient. 
C     In this way, values of eta near 1 makes the method to work hard 
C     inside the faces and values of eta near 0 makes the method to 
C     abandon the faces very quickly.

C     We always use as a first step in a line search procedure along a
C     first order direction the spectral steplength. This steplength 
C     must belong to the interval [lspgmi,lspgma].

      integer maxextrap,mininterp
      parameter ( maxextrap = 100 )
      parameter ( mininterp =   4 )

      double precision nint,next,delmin,eta,lspgma,lspgmi
      parameter ( nint    =   2.0d0 )
      parameter ( next    =   2.0d0 )
c      parameter ( delmin  =   1.d4 )
      parameter ( eta     =   0.9d0 )
      parameter ( lspgma  = 1.0d+10 )
      parameter ( lspgmi  = 1.0d-10 )

C     DIMENSIONS FOR SOME WORKING SPACES

C     In non-monotone line searches, given p, the last p objective 
C     functional values must be stored. For this reason we declare a 
C     vector with pmax double precision elements. So p must be less than
C     or equal to pmax.

C     Sometimes, is the problem is bad scaled, to request a small 
C     gradient norm at the solution may be inadequate. For this reason, 
C     a test to verify if this norm is not decreasing during maxitngp 
C     (MAXimum of ITerations with No Gradient Progress) consecutive 
C     iterations then we stop the method with a warning. As it is not 
C     expected a monotone decreasing of the gradient norm, again, the 
C     norm of the last maxitngp iterations must be saved. For this 
C     purpose, we declare a vector of tmax elements. So maxitngp must 
C     be less than or equal to tmax.
     
      integer tmax
      parameter ( tmax = 10000 )

C     HERE STARTS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OTHER ARGUMENTS OF GENCAN BEING 
C     SETTED BY EASYGENCAN. THESE ARGUMENTS MAY BE MODIFIED BY A COMMON 
C     USER IF, WITH THEIR SUGGESTED VALUES, GENCAN DOES NOT GIVE THE 
C     EXPECTED RESULT.

C     gtype indicates in which way the gradient of the objective 
C     function will be computed. If the user have been implemented the 
C     user-supplied evalnal subroutine to compute the gradient of the

C     time the gradient would be required.

C         other value if the gradient vector is not well defined at the

C         a unique bound-constrained problem then m, lambda and rho are 
C         dummy arguments. On the other hand, if GENCAN is been used in 
C         an Augmented Lagrangian framework then these arguments should 
C         be used for the number of constraints, the Lagrange 
C         multipliers approximation and the penalty parameters, 
C         respectively.''
C
C         end
C
C     If, on the other hand, the user is not able to provide evalnal 
C     subroutine, gtype argument must be set to 1 (ONE). In this case, 
C     every time GENCAN needs to compute the gradient of the objective 
C     function, an internal subroutine that approximates it by finite-
C     differences will be used (be aware that it maybe very time 
C     consuming). Moreover, note that the evalnal subroutine must still 
C     be present (with an empty body).

      gtype     =        0

C     htvtype indicates in which way the product of the Hessian of the
C     objective function times an arbitrary vector will be computed. If 
C     the user has not been implemented the user-supplied evalhd 
C     subroutine to do this task then htvtype argument must be set to 1 
C     (ONE). In this case an internal subroutine that approximates this 
C     product by incremental quotients will be used. Note that, even in 
C     this case, evalhd subroutine must be present (with an empty body). 
C     This is the default option and the empty-body subroutine follows:
C
C         subroutine evalhd(nind,ind,n,x,m,lambda,rho,d,hd,flag)
C
C         SCALAR ARGUMENTS
C         integer nind,n,m,flag
C
C         ARRAY ARGUMENTS
C         integer ind(nind)
C         double precision d(n),hd(n),lambda(m),rho(m),x(n)
C
C         flag = - 1
C
C         end
C
C     If, on the other hand, the user prefers to implement his/her own 
C     evalhd subroutine then htvtype argument must be set to 0 (ZERO). 
C     In this case, the product of the Hessian times vector d (input 
C     argument of evalhd subroutine) must be saved in vector hd (output 
C     argument of evalhd subroutine). The other arguments description as
C     well as some hints on how to implement your own evalhd subroutine 
C     can be found in the GENCAN arguments description.

C     When ALGENCAN uses GENCAN to solve the subproblems in the classical
C     Augmented Lagrangian framework, ALGENCAN uses its own evalhd
C     subroutine to overcome the lack of continuity of the second 
C     derivatives. So, when GENCAN is being used toghether with ALGENCAN,
C     htvtype must be equal to 0 (ZERO). On the other hand, if GENCAN is
C     being used stand-alone, just set htvtype equal to 1 (ONE) and add 
C     the empty-body subroutine described above.

      htvtype   =        1

C     ARGUMENTS RELATED TO STOPPING CRITERIA

C     Besides the stopping criterion related to the sup-norm of the 
C     continuous projected gradient, there is another stopping criterion 
C     related to its Euclidian norm. So, GENCAN stops the process if it 
C     finds a point at which the Euclidian norm of the continuous 
C     projected gradient is smaller than epsgpen.

      epsgpen   =    0.0d0

C     For an explanation of maxitngp see above the explanation of tmax 
C     in ''DIMENSIONS FOR SOME WORKING SPACES''. Just note that the 
C     value of maxitngp must be less than or equal to tmax.

      maxitngp  =     tmax

C     maxitnfp means MAXimum of allowed number of iterations with No 
C     Progress in the objective functional value. ''Progress'' from one 
C     iteration to the next one refers to ( fnew - fprev ). Since the 
C     begining of the algorithm we save the ''best progress'' and 
C     consider that there was no progress in an iteration if the 
C     progress of this iterations was smaller than epsnfp times the best 
C     progress. Finally, the algorithm stops if there was no progress 
C     during maxitnfp consecutive iterations.

      maxitnfp  =    maxit
      epsnfp    =    0.0d0

C     There is a stopping criterion that stops the method if a point 
C     with a functional value smaller than fmin is found. The idea 
C     behind this stopping criterion is to stop the method if the 
C     objective function is not bounded from below.

      fmin      = 1.0d-05

C     ARGUMENTS RELATED TO CONJUGATE GRADIENTS

C     When computing the Truncated Newton direction by Conjugate 
C     Gradients there is something similar to a ''trust-region radius''. 
C     This trust radius is updated from iteration to iteration depending 
C     on the agreement of the objective function and its quadratic 
C     model. But an initial value for the trust radius is required. If 
C     the user has a good guess for this initial value then it should be 
C     passed to GENCAN using the delta0 arguments. On the other hand, if 
C     delta0 is set to -1, a default value depending on the norm of the 
C     current point will be used.

      delta0    =  - 1.0d0
      delmin  =  1.d-2
c      delta0 = delmin

C     The ''trust-region'' can be like a ball (using Euclidian norm) or 
C     like a box (using sup-norm). This choice can be made using trtype 
C     (TRust region TYPE) argument. trtype equal to 0 means Euclidian 
C     norm and trtype equal to 1 means sup-norm.

      trtype    =        1

C     When the method is far from the solution, it may be not useful to 
C     do a very large effort in computing the Truncated Newton direction 
C     precisely. To avoid it, a fixed maximum number of iterations for 
C     Conjugate Gradients can be given to GENCAN. If the user would like 
C     to choose this maximum number of iterations for Conjugate 
C     Gradient then it should use the cgmaxit arguments. On the other 
C     hand he/she prefers to leave this task to GENCAN then he/she 
C     should set cgmaxit to -1.
 
      cgmaxit   =   -1

C     If the task of deciding the accuracy for computing the Truncated 
C     Newton direction is leaved to GENCAN then a default strategy based 
C     on increasing accuracies will be used. The proximity to the 
C     solution is estimated observing the norm of the projected gradient 
C     at the current point and locating it between that norm at the 
C     initial point and the expected value of that norm at the solution. 
C     Then the accuracy for the Truncated Newton direction of the 
C     current iteration will be computed taking a precision located in 
C     the same relative position with respect to two given values for 
C     the accuracies for the first and the last Truncated Newton 
C     direction calculations. These two accuracies (cgepsi and cgepsf, 
C     respectively) must be given by the user. Moreover, the expected 
C     value of the projected gradient norm at the solution (cggpnf) must
C     also be given by the user who must indicate setting argument 
C     cgscre to 1 or 2 if that norm is the Euclidian or the sup-norm.
      
      cggpnf    =  max( 1.0d-04, max( epsgpen, epsgpsn ) ) 
      cgscre    =        2
      cgepsi    =  1.0d-01
      cgepsf    =  1.0d-05

C     The next two arguments are used for an alternative stopping 
C     criterion for Conjugate Gradients. Conjugate Gradients method is 
C     stopped if the quadratic model makes no progress during maxitnqmp 
C     (MAXimum of ITerations with No Quadratic Model Progress) 
C     consecutive iterations. In this context, ''no progress'' means 
C     that the progress is smaller than epsnqmp (EPSilon to measure the 
C     No Quadratic Model Progress) times the best progress obtained 
C     during the previous iterations.

      epsnqmp   =  1.0d-04
      maxitnqmp =        5

C     Depending on how much the objective function seems to be a 
C     quadratic, function, Conjugate Gradients may take different 
C     decision. So, if the objective function is a quadratic function or 
C     is very similar to a quadratic function then the nearlyq argument 
C     should be set to TRUE, else, it should be set to FALSE. However, 
C     the option with nearlyq equal TRUE never showed good results. 
C     Regarding this unexpected no good performance, rather recently it 
C     was found a bug that affected the behaviour of GENCAN just in this 
C     case (See the April 1st, 2003 modifications report at the end of 
C     this file). So, new experiments setting nearlyq equal TRUE should 
C     be made. 

      nearlyq   =   .false.

C     coded by the user, taking into account that only nind components 
C     of d are nonnull and that ind is the set of indices of those 
C     components. In other words, the user must write evalhd in such a 
C     way that hd is the vector whose i-th entry is
C 
C               hd(i) = \Sum_{j=1}^{nind} H_{i,ind(j)} d_ind(j)
C
C     Moreover, the only components of hd that must be computed are 
C     those which correspond to the indices ind(1),...,ind(nind). 
C     However, observe that it must be assumed that, in d, the whole 
C     dense vector is present, with its n components, even the null 
C     ones. So, if the user decides to code evalhd without taking into 
C     account the presence of ind and nind, it can be easily done. A 
C     final observation: probably, if nind is close to n, it is not 
C     worthwhile to use ind, due to the cost of accessing the correct 
C     indices. 
C
C     Example: Assume that H is dense. The main steps of evalhd could 
C     be:
C
C          do i = 1,nind
C              indi     = ind(i)
C              hd(indi) = 0.0d0
C              do j = 1,nind
C                  indj     = ind(j)
C                  hd(indi) = hd(indi) + H(indi,indj) * d(indj)
C              end do
C          end do

C              being used to solve the bound-constrainted subproblems, m

C              epsgpen means EPSilon for the Projected Gradient Euclidian
C              Norm. It is a small positive number for declaring 
C              convergence when the Euclidian norm of the continuous 
C              projected gradient is less than or equal to epsgpen

C              Progress. See below for more details.
C

C              continuous projected gradient did not change during 
C              maxitngp consecutive iterations then the execution stops. 
C
C              RECOMMENDED: maxitngp = 10
C
C              CONSTRAINTS: maxitngp >= 1
C
C     fmin     double precision
C              function value for the stopping criteria f <= fmin
C
C              There is a stopping criterion that stops GENCAN if a 
C              point with a functional value smaller than fmin is found. 
C              The idea behind this stopping criterion is to stop the 
C              method if the objective function is not bounded from 
C              below.
C
C              RECOMMENDED: fmin = - infabs

C              maximum allowed number of iterations for each run of the 
C              Conjugate Gradient subalgorithm
C
C              The default values for this argument is max( 1, 10 * 
C              log( nind ) ), where nind is the number of free 
C              variables, and it will be used if the user sets ucgmaxit

C
C     cgscre   integer
C              See below
C
C     cggpnf   double precision
C              cgscre means conjugate gradient stopping criterion 
C              relation, and cggpnf means Conjugate Gradients projected 
C              gradient final norm. Both are related to a stopping 
C              criterion of Conjugate Gradients. This stopping criterion 
C              depends on the norm of the residual of the linear system. 
C              The norm of the residual should be less or equal than a 
C              ''small'' quantity which decreases as we are 
C              approximating the solution of the minimization problem 
C              (near the solution, better the truncated-Newton direction 
C              we aim). Then, the log of the required accuracy requested 
C              to Conjugate Gradient has a linear dependence on the log 
C              of the norm of the continuous projected gradient. This 
C              linear relation uses the squared Euclidian norm of the 
C              projected gradient if cgscre is equal to 1 and uses the 
C              sup-norm if cgscre is equal to 2. In addition, the 
C              precision required to CG is equal to cgepsi (conjugate 
C              gradient initial epsilon) at x0 and cgepsf (conjugate 
C              gradient final epsilon) when the Euclidian- or sup-norm 
C              of the projected gradient is equal to cggpnf (conjugate 
C              gradients projected gradient final norm) which is an 
C              estimation of the value of the Euclidian- or sup-norm of 
C              the projected gradient at the solution.
C
C              RECOMMENDED: cgscre = 1, cggpnf = epsgpen; or
C                           cgscre = 2, cggpnf = epsgpsn.
C
C              CONSTRAINTS:  allowed values for cgscre are just 1 or 2
C                            cggpnf >= 0.0
C
C     cgepsi   double precision
C              See below
C
C     cgepsf   double precision
C              small positive numbers for declaring convergence of the 
C              Conjugate Gradients subalgorithm when ||r||_2 < cgeps * 
C              ||rhs||_2, where r is the residual and rhs is the right 
C              hand side of the linear system, i.e., CG stops when the 
C              relative error of the solution is smaller than cgeps. 
C
C              cgeps varies from cgepsi to cgepsf in a way that depends 
C              on cgscre as follows:
C
C              i) CASE cgscre = 1: log10(cgeps^2) depends linearly on 
C              log10(||g_P(x)||_2^2) which varies from ||g_P(x_0)||_2^2 
C              to epsgpen^2
C
C              ii)  CASE cgscre = 2: log10(cgeps) depends linearly on 
C              log10(||g_P(x)||_inf) which varies from ||g_P(x_0)||_inf 
C              to epsgpsn
C
C              RECOMMENDED: cgepsi = 1.0d-01, cgepsf = 1.0d-05
C
C              CONSTRAINTS: cgepsi >= cgepsf >= 0.0
C
C     epsnqmp  double precision
C              See below
C
C     maxitnqmp integer
C              This and the previous argument are used for a stopping 
C              criterion of the Conjugate Gradients subalgorithm. If the 
C              progress in the quadratic model is smaller than fraction 
C              of the best progress ( epsnqmp * bestprog ) during 
C              maxitnqmp consecutive iterations then CG is stopped 
C              declaring ''not enough progress of the quadratic model''.
C
C              RECOMMENDED: epsnqmp = 1.0d-04, maxitnqmp = 5
C
C              CONSTRAINTS: epsnqmp >= 0.0, maxitnqmp >= 1.
C
C     nearlyq  logical
C              If the objective function is (nearly) quadratic, use the 
C              option nearlyq = TRUE. Otherwise, keep the default 
C              option.
C
C              If, in an iteration of CG we find a direction d such that 
C              d^T H d <= 0 then we take the following decision:
C
C              (i) If nearlyq = TRUE then we take direction d and try to 
C              go to the boundary choosing the best point among the two 
C              points at the boundary and the current point. 
C
C              (ii) If nearlyq = FALSE then we stop at the current point.
C
C              Moreover, if the objective function is quadratic more 
c              effort is due in computing the Truncated Newton direction.
C
C              RECOMMENDED: nearlyq = FALSE
C
C              CONSTRAINTS: allowed values are just TRUE or FALSE.
C
C     nint     double precision
C              Constant for the interpolation. See the description of 
C              sigma1 and sigma2 above. Sometimes, in a line search, we 
C              take the new trial step as the previous one divided by 
C              nint
C
C              RECOMMENDED: nint = 2.0
C
C              CONSTRAINTS: nint > 1.0.
C
C     next     double precision
C              Constant for the extrapolation. When extrapolating we 
C              try alpha_new = alpha * next

C
C              CONSTRAINTS: next > 1.0
C
C     mininterp integer
C              Constant for testing if, after having made at least 
C              mininterp interpolations, the steplength is too small. In
C              that case, failure of the line search is declared (may be 
C              the direction is not a descent direction due to an error 
C              in the gradient calculations). Use mininterp greater 
C              than or equal to maxfc for inhibit this stopping 
C              criterion
C
C              RECOMMENDED: mininterp = 4

C
C     gtype    integer
C              gtype indicates in which way the gradient of the 
C              objective function will be computed. If the user have 
C              been implemented the user-supplied evalnal subroutine to 
C              compute the gradient of the objective function then 
C              gtype argument must be set to 0 (ZERO) and the user-
C              supplied evalnal subroutine will be called by GENCAN any 
C              time the gradient would be required.

C
C     inform   integer
C              This output parameter tells what happened in this 
C              subroutine, according to the following conventions:
C 
C              0 = convergence with small Euclidian norm of the 
C                  continuous projected gradient (smaller than epsgpen);
C
C              1 = convergence with small sup-norm of the continuous 
C                  projected gradient (smaller than epsgpsn);
C
C              2 = the algorithm stopped by ''lack of progress'', that 
C                  means that f(xk) - f(x_{k+1}) <= epsnfp * 
C                  max{ f(x_j) - f(x_{j+1}, j < k } during maxitnfp 
C                  consecutive iterations. If desired, set maxitnfp 
C                  equal to maxit to inhibit this stopping criterion.
C
C              3 = the algorithm stopped because the order of the 
C                  Euclidian norm of the continuous projected gradient 
C                  did not change during maxitngp consecutive 
C                  iterations. Probably, we are asking for an 
C                  exaggerated small norm of continuous projected 
C                  gradient for declaring convergence. If desired, set
C                  maxitngp equal to maxit to inhibit this stopping 
C                  criterion.
C
C              4 = the algorithm stopped because the functional value 
c                  is very small (smaller than fmin). If desired, set 
C                  fmin equal to minus infabs to inhibit this stopping 
C                  criterion.
C
C              6 = too small step in a line search. After having made at 
C                  least mininterp interpolations, the steplength 
C                  becames small. ''small steplength'' means that we are 
C                  at point x with direction d and step alpha, and 
C
C                  alpha * ||d||_infty < max( epsabs, epsrel * 
C                  ||x||_infty ). 
C 
C                  In that case failure of the line search is declared 
C                  (may be the direction is not a descent direction due 
C                  to an error in the gradient calculations). If 
C                  desired, set mininterp equal to maxfc to inhibit this 
C                  stopping criterion.
C
C              7 = it was achieved the maximum allowed number of 
C                  iterations (maxit);
C
C              8 = it was achieved the maximum allowed number of 
C                  function evaluations (maxfc);
C
C            < 0 = error in evalal, evalnal or evalhd subroutines.

C     This subroutine implements the Conjugate Gradients method for 
C     minimizing the quadratic approximation q(s) of f(x) at x, where
C
C     q(s) = 1/2 s^T H s + g^T s,
C
C        H = \nabla^2 f(x),
C
C        g = \nabla f(x),
C
C     subject to || s || <= delta and l <= x + s <= u.
C
C     In the constraint ''|| s || <= delta'', the norm will be the
C     Euclidian norm if the input parameter trtype is equal to 0, and
C     it will be the Sup norm if trtype is equal to 1.
C
C     The method returns an approximation s to the solution such that 
C     ||H s + g||_2 <= eps * ||g||_2; or converges to the boundary of 
C     ||s||_2 <= delta and l <= x + s <= u; or finds a point s and a 
C     direction d such that q(s + alpha d) = q(s) for any alpha, i.e., 
C     d^T H d = g^T d = 0.
C
C     On Entry
C
C     nind     integer
C              number of free variables (this is thee dimension in 
C              which this subroutine will work)
C
C     ind      integer ind(n)
C              array which contains, in the first nind positions, the
C              identifiers of the free variables
C
C     n        integer
C              dimension of the full space
C
C     x        double precision x(n)
C              point at which f function is being approximated by the
C              quadratic model
C
C              The first nind positions of x contains the free variables 
C              x_ind(1), x_ind(2), ..., x_ind(nind).
C
C     m        integer
C     lambda   double precision lambda(m)
C     rho      double precision rho(m)
C              These three parameters are not used nor modified by 
C              GENCAN and they are passed as arguments to the user-
C              defined subroutines evalal and evalnal to compute the 
C              objective function and its gradient, respectively. 
C              Clearly, in an Augmented Lagrangian context, if GENCAN is 
C              being used to solve the bound-constrainted subproblems, m 
C              would be the number of constraints, lambda the Lagrange 
C              multipliers approximation and rho the penalty parameters
C
C     g        double precision g(n)
C              linear coefficient of the quadratic function
C
C              This is \nabla f(x) and it also contains in the first 
C              nind positions the components g_ind(1), g_ind(2), ..., 
C              g_ind(nind).
C    
C              IMPORTANT: the linear algebra of this subroutine lies in 
C              a space of dimension nind. The value of the full 
C              dimension n, the non-free variables (which are at the end 
C              of array x) and its gradient components (which are at the 
C              and of array g) are, at this moment, being used to 
C              approximate the Hessian times vector products by 
C              incremental quotients.

C              See below
C
C     maxitnqmp integer
C              This and the previous one parameter are used for a 
C              stopping criterion of the conjugate gradient 
C              subalgorithm. If the progress in the quadratic model is 
C              less or equal than a fraction of the best progress 
C              ( epsnqmp * bestprog ) during maxitnqmp consecutive 
C              iterations then CG is stopped by not enough progress of

C
C     nearlyq  logical
C              if function f is (nearly) quadratic, use the option 
C              nearlyq = TRUE. Otherwise, keep the default option.
C
C              if, in an iteration of CG we find a direction d such that
C              d^T H d <= 0 then we take the following decision:
C
C              (i) if nearlyq = TRUE then take direction d and try to go 
C              to the boundary choosing the best point among the two 
C              point at the boundary and the current point. 
C
C              (ii) if nearlyq = FALSE then we stop at the current 
C              point.

C
C              (you take some risk using this option but, unless you 
C              have a good evalhd subroutine, incremental quotients is a
C              very cheap option)
C
C     trtype   integer
C              type of trust-region radius
C              trtype = 0 means 2-norm trust-region

C     This subroutine implements the line search used in the Truncated
C     Newton direction.

C              which this subroutine will work)
C
C     ind      integer ind(n)
C              array which contains, in the first nind positions, the
C              identifiers of the free variables
C

C              dimension of the full space
C
C     x        double precision x(n)

C
C     m        integer
C     lambda   double precision lambda(m)
C     rho      double precision rho(m)
C              These three parameters are not used nor modified by 
C              GENCAN and they are passed as arguments to the user-
C              defined subroutines evalal and evalnal to compute the 
C              objective function and its gradient, respectively. 
C              Clearly, in an Augmented Lagrangian context, if GENCAN is 
C              being used to solve the bound-constrainted subproblems, m 
C              would be the number of constraints, lambda the Lagrange 
C              multipliers approximation and rho the penalty parameters
C

C              components g_ind(1), g_ind(2), ..., g_ind(nind).
C    
C              IMPORTANT: the linear algebra of this subroutine lies in 
C              a space of dimension nind. The value of the full 
C              dimension n, the non-free variables (which are at the end 
C              of array x) and its gradient components (which are at the 
C              end of array g) are also used and updated any time the

C              constant for testing if, after having made at least 
C              mininterp interpolations, the steplength is so small. 
C              In that case failure of the line search is declared (may 
C              be the direction is not a descent direction due to an 
C              error in the gradient calculations) 
C
C              RECOMMENDED: mininterp = 4

C
C              (provided you have the evalg subroutine)
C
C     iprint   integer
C              Commands printing. Nothing is printed if iprint is 
C              smaller than 2. If iprint is greater than or equal to 
C              2, GENCAN iterations information is printed. If iprint 
C              is greater than or equal to 3, line searches and 
C              Conjugate Gradients information is printed.

C              constant for the beta condition <dk, g(xk + dk)>  <  beta 
C              * <dk,gk>. If (xk + dk) satisfies the Armijo condition 
C              but does not satisfy the beta condition then the point is 
C              accepted, but if it satisfied the Armijo condition and 
C              also satisfies the beta condition then we know that there 
C              is the possibility for a successful extrapolation
C
C              RECOMMENDED: beta = 0.5
C
C     sigma1   double precision
C     sigma2   double precision
C              constant for the safeguarded interpolation

C     epsabs   double precision
C     infrel   double precision
C     infabs   double precision
C              this constants mean a ``relative small number'', ``an 
C              absolute small number'', and ``infinite or a very big
C              number''. Basically, a quantity A is considered 
C              negligible with respect to another quantity B if 
C              |A| < max ( epsrel * |B|, epsabs ) 
C
C              RECOMMENDED: epsrel = 10^{-10}, epsabs = 10^{-20},

C
C     inform   integer
C              This output parameter tells what happened in this 
C              subroutine, according to the following conventions:
C
C              0 = convergence with an Armijo-like criterion
C                  (f(xnew) <= f(x) + 1.0d-4 * alpha * <g,d>);
C
C              4 = the algorithm stopped because the functional value
C                  is very small (f <= fmin);
C
C              6 = so small step in the line search. After having made 
C                  at least mininterp interpolations, the steplength 
C                  becames small. ``small steplength'' means that we are 
C                  at point x with direction d and step alpha, and, for 
C                  all i, 
C
C                  |alpha * d(i)| .le. max ( epsrel * |x(i)|, epsabs ). 
C 
C                  In that case failure of the line search is declared 
C                  (may be the direction is not a descent direction 
C                  due to an error in the gradient calculations). Use
C                  mininterp > maxfc for inhibit this criterion;
C
C              8 = it was achieved the maximum allowed number of
C                  function evaluations (maxfc);
C
C            < 0 = error in evalf or evalg subroutines.

C
C     Report of modifications.
C
C     February 18th, 2005.
C
C     1) An unsed format statement, previously used to automaticaly
C     generates some tables, was deleted.
C
C     2) An unmateched parenthesis was corrected in the format
C     statement used to stop GENCAN due to a small step in a line search.
C
C     February 16th, 2005.
C
C     1) The evalhd subroutine used by default in GENCAN is now the one
C     implemented in calchddiff, which approximates the Hessian-vector
C     product by incremental quotients. The implementation used to 
C     overcome the non twice continuously differentiability of the 
C     classical (PHR) Augmented Lagrangian function is now part of 
C     ALGENCAN (and not GENCAN). So, to use GENCAN inside ALGENCAN, 
C     htvtype argument must be set equal to 0 (ZERO).
C
C     2) The commented version of the empty function evalhd that must
C     be added when GENCAN is beinf used stand-alone was wrong. The
C     arguments declarations had been copied from evalnal. It was 
C     corrected.
C
C     November 10th, 2004.
C
C     1) After several test, all references to nonmontone line search
C     schemes were deleted.
C
C     September 28th, 2004.
C
C     1) Subroutines were checked an some absent arguments explanations
C     were added
C
C     2) Some calling sequences were modified to group related arguments
C
C     3) Arguments and local variables declarations were reordered in
C     alphabetical order.
C
C     3) Shrink and expand subroutines were modified to deal with just
C     one vector at a time. In this way, they are now being called from
C     calc* subroutines.
C
C     September 27th, 2004.
C
C     1) All comments were arranged to fit into the 72-columns format
C
C     2) Unused variable goth, which was prepared to indicate whether 
C     the Hessian matrix have been evaluated at the current point, was 
C     deleted from CG subroutine.
C
C     3) A spell check was used to correct the comments
C
C     September 21th, 2004.
C
C     1) In the stopping criterion where the progress in the objective 
C     function is verified, ''itnfp .ge. maxitnfp'' was changed for 
C     ''itnfp .gt. maxitnfp'', to make the choice maxitnfp equal to 1 
C     sounds reasonable.
C
C     2) Moreover, the previous chance came from the addition in the 
C     comments of GENCAN of the ''constraints'' information which makes 
C     clear to the user the values each argument may assume.
C
C     3) In the calculations of the first ''trust-radius'' for Conjugate 
C     Gradients, ''if( udelta0 .lt. 0.d0 ) then'' was changed by ''if 
C     ( udelta0 .le. 0.0d0 ) then'' to also make the default GENCAN 
C     choice of this initial trust-radius in the case of the user have 
C     been setted udelta = 0 by mistake.
C
C     4) The same for ucgmaxit.
C
C     5) In the line search subroutines spgls and tnls, ''if ( interp 
C     .gt. mininterp .and. samep ) then'' was changes by ''.ge.''.
C
C     6) Some comments of GENCAN arguments were re-written.
C
C     September 16th, 2004.
C
C     1) With the reconfiguration of the calc* subroutines (see (1) 
C     below) there were a number of redundant parameters in calchd and 
C     evalhd subroutines. These parameters were eliminated.
C
C     September 13th, 2004.
C
C     1) Subroutines named calc* that work in the reduced space always
C     call the corresponding eval* subroutine. As it was, calcg (that
C     computes the gradient in the reduced space) called evalg or 
C     evalgdiff depending on gtype parameter. The same was for calchd. 
C     Now, calcg calls evalg, calchd calls evalhd, and calchddiff (new) 
C     approximates the Hessian times vector product by incremental 
C     quotients calling calcg or calcgdiff depending on gtype parameter.
C     An improvement of this modification is that calcg does not call 
C     evalg or evalgdiff (both work in the full space) any more but it 
C     approximates the gradient vector in the reduced space (by central 
C     finite differences) calling 2 * nind times evalf subroutine.
C
C     2) Some comments were added inside evalg and evalhd user supplied
C     subroutines alerting about the relation of these subroutines and
C     the parameters gtype and htvtype, respectively.
C
C     3) Description of tnls subroutine was slightly modified.
C
C     4) The description of htvtype parameter in gencan was again 
C     slightly modified.
C
C     5) With the introduction of the parameter lambda (that in the
C     context of Augmented Lagrangians is used to store the 
C     approximation of the Lagrange multipliers) the name of the 
C     variable used for spectral steplength was changed from lambda to 
C     lamspg. In addition, lammax was changed to lspgma and lammin to 
C     lspgmi.
C
C     6) Modifications introduced in June 15th, 2004 and May 5th, 2004
C     were, in fact, made in this version on September 13th, 2004.
C
C     June 15th, 2004.
C
C     1) The fmin stopping criterion and the maximum number of
C     functional evaluation stopping criterion were erroneously being 
C     tested before the main loop. It was just redundant and, for this 
C     reason, deleted.
C
C     May 5th, 2004.
C
C     1) Incorporated into an Augmented Lagrangian framework.
C
C     a) evalf and evalg were renamed as evalal and evalnal, 
C        respectively.
C
C     b) m,lambda,rho were added as parameters of the subroutines evalal 
C        and evalnal, and, as a consequence, as parameters of almost all 
C        the other subroutines.
C
C     2) The comment of htvtype parameter of gencan was in portuguese
C     and it was translated into english.
C
C     3) A nonmonotone version of gencan is starting to be studied.
C     Parameters p and lastfv(0:p-1) were added to gencan, spgls, and
C     tnls to allow a nonmonotone line search. Array lastfv is now 
C     been updated for saving the last p functional values and the 
C     nonmonotone line searches are been done in a SPG or a 
C     Truncated Newton direction. p = 1 means monotone line search 
C     and is recommended until this study finish.
C
C     April 13th, 2004.
C
C     1) The modifications introduced in the occasion of the IRLOC 
C     development and re-development (October 21th, 2003 and February 
C     19th, 2003, respectively) were in fact made in this version on 
C     April 13th, 2004. The motivation to do this was to unify two 
C     parallel and different version of GENCAN (created, obviously, by 
C     mistake).
C
C     2) The complete reference of the GENCAN paper was finally added.
C
C     May 14th, 2003.
c
C     1) The way amax2 and amax2n were being computing may caused a 
C     segmentation fault. Its initialization was changed from infty and
C     -infty to 1.0d+99 and -1.0d+99, respectively. Using infty, when
C     combined with a big trust region radius, the final value of amax2
C     or amax2n may cause the impression that a bound is being attained, 
C     when it is not. "Redundant" ifs inside the amax2 and anax2n 
C     calculation were deleted. It should considered the possibility of 
C     using two constants, namely, bignum = 1.0d+20 and infty = 1.0d+99, 
C     instead of just infty. 
C
C     Modification introduced in October 21, 2003 in occasion of the
C     IRLOC re-development:
C
C     1) The stooping criteria related to functional value smaller than
C     fmin and exhaustion of maximum allowed number of functional 
C     evaluations have been done after the line search. And the 
C     questions were done as "if line search flag is equal to 4" or "if 
C     line search flag is equal to 8". But it was wrong in the case, for 
C     example, inside the line search, a functional value such that f <= 
C     fmin and the Armijo criterion was satisfied. In such case, the 
C     line search flag was being setted to 0 and not to 4. And gencan 
C     did not stop by the fmin criterion. Now, both stooping criteria 
C     are tested at the begining of the main gencan loop and just the 
C     stooping criteria by small line search step is tested after the 
C     line search.
C
C     Modification introduced in February 19, 2003 in occasion of the
C     IRLOC development:
C
C     1) The description of epsnfp parameter of GENCAN was modified. It
C     was written that to inhibit the related stopping criterion (lack
C     of function progress) it was necessary just set epsnfp = 0 when
C     it is also necessary to set maxitnfp = maxit. it was added in the
C     explanation.
C
C     2) In the explanation at the beginning of GENCAN it was written 
C     that cgscre parameter should be double precision. This comment was 
C     wrong. The correct type for cgscre parameter is integer.
C
C     Modifications introduced near April 1st 2003 in occasion of the 
C     PHR and inequality-constraints Augmented Lagrangian methods 
C     development:
C
C     1) The use of iprint was redefined and iprint2 was deleted.
C
C     2) The way to detect no progress in the log of the projected 
C     gradient norm was changed. As it was, ''no progress'' means no
C     reduction in the projected gradient norm over M iterations.
C     But this criterion implicitly assumed that the projected
C     gradient norm must decrease monotonously. Is it is clearly not
C     true, the criterion was changed by a non-monotone decrease
C     criterion. Now, progress means that the projected gradient
C     norm is, at each iteration, smaller than the maximum over the
C     last M iterations. And "no progress" means the it does not 
C     occurs during  not smaller than the 
C
C     3 ) The computation of qamaxn inside cg subroutine was in the 
C     wrong place (it was being used before computed) and it may was 
C     the reason for which the option nearlyq = .true. never worked 
C     properly. With this correction this option should be tested again.
C
C     On September 29th, 2004, we did a new test using the 41 bound
C     constrained problems with quadratic objective function from the
C     CUTE collection. The behaviour of GENCAN setting nearly equal
C     to true or false was indistinguishable. The test did not
C     include the different choices for the maximum number of CG
C     iterations being restricted to evaluate the different
C     alternatives for the case of finding a direction d such that
C     d^t H d <= 0. As a conclusion of this experiment we continue
C     recommending as a default choice to set nearlyq equal to false.
C
C     Modifications introduced from March 1st to March 21th of 2002
C     in occasion of the ISPG development:
C
C     1) Comments of some new parameters introduced in the previous
C     modification
C
C     2) As it was, in the first iteration of GENCAN (when kappa takes
C     value equal 1) and for one-dimensional faces, cgmaxit(the maximum 
C     number of Conjugate Gradient iterations to compute the internal to
C     the face truncated-Newton direction) was being 0. As it is 
C     obviously wrong, we add a max between what was being computed and 
C     one to allow at least one CG iteration.
C
C     3) Parameter inform in subroutines evalf, evalg and evalhd 
C     supplied by the user was added
C
C     Modifications introduced from May 31th to November 2nd of 2001
C     in occasion of the ALGENCAN development:
C
C     Fixed bugs:
C
C     1) The first spectral steplength was not been projected in the
C     [lspgmi,lspgma] interval.
C
C     2) The conjugate gradients accuracy (cgeps) which is linearly
C     dependent of the Euclidian norm of the projected gradient, was
C     also not been projected in the interval [cgepsi,cgepsf].
C
C     3) Conjugate gradients said that it was being used an Euclidian
C     norm trust region when it has really being used an infinite norm
C     trust region and viceversa.
C
C     4) Sometimes, the analytic gradient has been used although the
C     user choose the finite differences option.
C
C     Modifications:
C
C     1) To avoid roundoff errors, an explicit detection of at least one
C     variable reaching its bound when a maximum step is being made was
C     added.
C
C     2) The way in which two points were considered very similar in, 
C     for example, the interpolations and the extrapolations (which was 
C     dependent of the infinity norm of the points) showed to be very
C     scale dependent. A new version which test the difference 
C     coordinate to coordinate was done. In this was the calculus of the 
C     current point x and the descent direction sup-norm is not done any
C     more.
C
C     3) The same constants epsrel and epsabs were used as small 
C     relative and absolute values for, for example, detecting similar
C     points and for finite differences. Now, epsrel and epsabs are used 
C     for detecting similar points (and the recommended values are 
C     10^{-10} and 10^{-20}, respectively) and new constants sterel and 
C     steabs were introduced for finite differences (and the recommended 
C     values are 10^{-7} and 10^{-10}, respectively).
C
C     4) Two new stopping criteria for CG were added: (i) we stop if
C     two consecutive iterates are too  close; and (ii) we also
C     stop if there is no enough quadratic model progress during
C     maxitnqmp iterations.
C
C     5) The linear relation between the conjugate gradient accuracy
C     and the norm of the projected gradient can be computed using
C     the Euclidian- and the sup-norm of the projected gradient (only
C     Euclidian norm version was present in the previous version. The
C     linear relation is such that the CG accuracy is cgepsi when the
C     projected gradient norm value is equal to the value corresponding
C     to the initial guess and the CG accuracy is cgepsf when the
C     projected gradient norm value is cgrelf).
C
C     6) Inside Conjugate Gradients, the Euclidian-norm is been computed 
C     using an algorithm developed by C.L.LAWSON, 1978 JAN 08. Numerical 
C     experiments showed that the performance of GENCAN depends 
C     basically on the conjugate gradients performance and stopping
C     criteria and that the conjugate gradients depends on the way the
C     Euclidian-norm is been computed. These things deserve further 
C     research.
C
C     7) In the Augmented Lagrangian algorithm ALGENCAN, which uses
C     GENCAN to solve the bounded constrained subproblems, the maximum
C     number of Conjugate Gradients iterations (cgmaxit), which in this
C     version is linearly dependent of the projected gradient norm, was 
C     set to 2 * (# of free variables). As CG is not using restarts we 
C     do not know very well what this means. On the other hand, the 
C     accuracy (given by cgeps) continues being more strict when we are 
C     near to the solution and less strict when we ar far from the 
C     solution.
