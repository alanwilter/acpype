INSTALLATION
############

The main installation of Packmol Memgen is intended to be installed within AmberTools20. If that is not the case
the following instructions could be follow to make it run as a stand-alone, though it is not officially supported.

Dependencies:
Boost (tested with 1.54 or above)
gfortran & gcc (tested with 4.8 and above)
python 2.7 (or above)

The script should work as is. Includes a setup.py script which should work as usual:

``python setup.py install``

or

``pip install .``

You can specify a custom installation location with --home=<FOLDER> or --prefix=<FOLDER>, respectively.
Testing of the software can be performed in the example folder, by executing "./example.sh".
This folder can be easily cleaned by executing "./example.sh clean"



##############
CHANGELOG 
##############

v1.2.1:
 - Fixed using %v/v concentrations for solutes.
v1.2.0:
 - Added sterols ergosterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol, campesterol
 - Reformated and cleaned FF parameter files
 - Fixed bogus packing params
 - Added functionality for using alternate solvents
 - User provided memgen.parm or solvent.parm extend and not only replace parameters used by default
 - Added support for coarse graining systems with SIRAH 
 - Fixed bug that caused charmmlipid2amber to fail when packing a single residue molecule
 - Support for Lipid21 / Lipid17 can be selected.
v1.1.0:
 - Added parameters for cardiolipin headgroup
 - New PDBs generated with stereocenter constraints
 - Added --solute_prot_dist to set free diffusion simulations with ligands starting at a distance of a potential target.
 - Fixed rounding error for solute placement in water compartments
 - Added flags --apl_offset --self_assembly 
 - Small code changes
v1.0.8:
 - Added preliminary code for --double_span option for proteins with two transmembrane regions. Can be used with --preoriented given proper MEM atoms
 - Added preliminary code for using different surface geometries
 - Added --tight_box to use dimensions calculated during the packing process in the leap parametrization
v1.0.7:
 - Added APL values derived from Lipid17 DOPC:X 4:1 300K 1 bar. Flag to use old APL values added.
 - Allow to pass custom memgen.parm file with --memgen_parm
v1.0.5:
 - Changed pdb file distro
 - Added experimental pdbs for all possible combinations
 - Added PI & multiple protonation states parameters
 - memgen.parm to all missing lipids
v1.0.2:
 - Fixed the way dims and solute_inmem are handled
 - Included parameters for lysophospholipid heads PE PG PC // BETA! (pdbs and memgen.parm)
 - Fixed and updated internal charmmlipid2amber.csv
 - Added missing MG pdb
v1.0.1:
 - Added flags dims, gaff2 and solute_charge
 - Possible to specify concentrations as percentages. Depends on pdbremix at the moment! 
v1.0.0:
 - Modified POPC pdb to avoid bug that apparently caused it to be stuck in a maxima
 - Fixed bug while trying to find lipid APL with the same headgroup
 - Newest packmol version 18.169
 - Inclusion of boost 1.69 // compatible with gcc 8 compilers  // AmberTools19 includes boost!
 - Mac compatible compilation code 
v0.9.95:
 - Added writeout flag to control intermediate saves. Allows shorter nloops.
 - Adapted code to Leandro's nloop_all. 
 - New packmol version with bug fixes (18.104). Should fix isues with Windows WSL.
 - Python 3 friendly code.
 - Added cubic flag for solvating. reducebuild for protonating HIS.
 - Fixed multi bilayer z-dim size bug.
 - Changed solute_con to accept either number of molecules or concentrations.
v0.9.9:
 - Possibility to build stacked membrane systems by calling --lipids multiple times. PDB files to be embeded have to be included with --pdb now, to make possible to specify multiple inputs.
 - A charge imbalance can be specified between compartments (CompEL!)
 - If desired, a specific per leaflet composition can be specified.
 - The orientation by MEMEMBED is with the N-terminus to the "inside" (or to lower z values). Added flag (--n_ter) to set this per protein in case of multiple bilayers.
v0.9.8:
 - Modified print commands for logging statements.
 - Added optional grid building command (testing!)
 - Added functions that allow minimization and parametrization, given that AMBERHOME is defined
 - Added option to keep ligands after protein alignment
v0.9.7:
 - Check if ions are required before adding the line to packmol (avoids "bug" that adds one molecule even when the number is 0)
v0.9.6:
 - Possible to add solutes in water based on PDB input
 - Modified sigterm command for runs
 - Reduced the verbosity. Can be called with --verbose
v0.9.5:
 - Changed parsing system to argparse
 - Adapted to work with Wooey
 - Implemented charmmlipid2amber as a module // charmm and amber outputs
v0.9.1:
 - Now is possible to create membranes without proteins by setting the PDB as None
 - The xy dimensions can be set with the flag -distxy_fix. This flag is required if no PDB is given
v0.9:
 - Multiple lipids available! (-available_lipids for a list)
 - Detection of neutralization / salt concentration included
v0.7:
 - Volume estimation by building grid based on PDBREMIX
 - Search for AMBERHOME definition, using reduce if available
 - Automated alignment available based on MEMEMBED
 - Tiny code clean-up
v0.3:
 - Distance is measured considering worst case scenario (max x and y considered to be on the diagonal)
 - Added progress bar for all-together packing step
 - Filter for non-defined arguments
