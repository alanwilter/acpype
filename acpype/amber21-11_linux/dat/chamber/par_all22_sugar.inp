*  PARAMETER_4. New parameter file for sugars developed by fitting to small 
*  molecules and sugars. These parameters are meant to be compatible with the
*  Charmm23 force field, and were based upon Alex MacKerell's nucleic acid
*  parameters; wherever possible, his basic parameters, atom types, charges,
*  and van der Waals parameters have been retained. This set defines a 
*  separate atom type CBS for the anomeric carbon C1 in beta sugar anomers. 
*  Beta version; future revisions are still possible.
