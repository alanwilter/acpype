# ----- leaprc for loading phosphorylated amino acid residues
#
# This file contains optimized parameters for phosphorylated amino acids:
#
# PTR:   phosphotyrosine with a -2 net charge
# SEP:   phosphoserine with a -2 net charge  
# TPO:   phosphothreonine with a -2 net charge
# Y1P:   phosphotyrosine with a -1 net charge
# S1P:   phosphoserine with a -1 net charge  
# T1P:   phosphothreonine with a -1 net charge
# H1D:   phosphohistidine (ND1) with a 0 net charge
# H2D:   phosphohistidine (ND1) with a -1 net charge
# H1E:   phosphohistidine (NE2) with a 0 net charge
# H2E:   phosphohistidine (NE2) with a -1 net charge
#
# To use these residues, load this file into leap, after the Amber-FF, e.g.:
#
# > source leaprc.ff19B
# > source leaprc.phosaa19SB
#
#
#	load atom type hybridizations
