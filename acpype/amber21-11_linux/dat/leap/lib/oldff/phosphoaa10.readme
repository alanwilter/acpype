The "phosphoaa10.lib" file contains preliminary parameters for phosphorylated
amino acids:

PTR:   phosphotyrosine with a 2- net charge  (using PDB nomenclature)
SEP:   phosphoserine with a 2- net charge  (using PDB nomenclature)
TPO:   phosphothreonine with a 2- net charge  (using PDB nomenclature)
H2D:   phosphohistidine with a 2- net charge  (PDB calls this "HIP", but
             that conflicts with long-standing Amber usage)
Y1P:   phosphotyrosine with a 1- net charge  (nonstandard nomenclature)
S1P:   phosphoserine with a 1- net charge  (nonstandard nomenclature)
T1P:   phosphothreonine with a 1- net charge  (nonstandard nomenclature)

The charge model comes from:
