#  Notes
#  For use with fluorescent protein chromophores.
#  Tested with EGFP, EBFP, mCherry, ECFP, EYFP, and DsRed proteins
#  Intended for use with ff14SB, ff19SB and related force fields from the parm94 family.
#  The chromophores are described using both gaff and parm94 atom types. The gaff parameters
#  are described by this file and the frcmod and lib files loaded below. The user must load
#  one of the above parm94-type force fields for those parameters.
#  For further details see publication by Breyfogle, Blood, Rosnik, and Krueger in preparation.

# Add in gaff atom types that are needed to describe the chromophores.
